* Check support for SubPackages.
* Move cmsBuild to use parser.error in the case of wrong options / options
  combination.
* Integrate the PackageManagement.pl script into cmsBuild.
* Rewrite the upload workflow to be failure safe.

Possible features
-----------------
* Better support for non gcc compilers.
