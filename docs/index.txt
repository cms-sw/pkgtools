cmsBuild is a build script for [CMS](http://cern.ch/cms) offline software, which works on Linux and Macosx.

For more information on how to use within CMS please have a look at [here][aptinstaller].

It builds software based on a set recipe find in a given directory, and can package the various products in binary packages ([RPMs][rpm]) so that they can be deployed (without need for root access) on multiple machine using apt-get (which is internally supported) or similar technologies.

It supports having different version of the same package in parallel.

After modifying one build recipe, cmsBuild is smart enough to (re)-build only the minimal set of packages that depends on such a change.

cmsBuild is able to take advantage of powerful build machines by building non related packages in parallel.

Getting the code
================

The latests version of PKGTOOLS can be obtained from the CMS CVS repository by doing:

    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cmssw.cvs.cern.ch:/cvs/CMSSW login
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cmssw.cvs.cern.ch:/cvs/CMSSW co PKGTOOLS

The repository can also be browsed via its [CVSweb interface](http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/COMP/PKGTOOLS/).

Quick Start
===========

To build a given package, bootstrapping the area from the default CMS distribution:

    cvs co -r <sometag> CMSDIST 
    PKGTOOLS/cmsBuild -c CMSDIST -a <architecture> build <package>

To build a package and upload it to the cms repository:

    cvs co -r <sometag> CMSDIST
    PKGTOOLS/cmsBuild -c CMSDIST -a <architecture> upload <package>
