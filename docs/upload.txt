The subcommand `cmsBuild upload` can be used to upload packages to a remote apt repository.

## SYNOPSIS

    cmsBuild [<additional options>] [-c <cmsdist-location>] -a <architecture> \
             upload <package> [<package2> .. <packageN>]

## OPTIONS

The main options which can be specified are:

* `-c`: the location of the directory containing the spec files to be built.
* `â€“a`: the architecture for which we are doing the build.

Documentation about the `<additional options>` which can be specified can be obtained by passing `--help` on the command line.

An additional option `--no-bootstrap` can be used to build and upload the bootstrap kit for a new architecture not yet present on server.
