cmsBuild spec file syntax
=========================

The instructions that tell cmsBuild how to build an rpm are written in a so 
called `spec file`. 
cmsBuild uses a special kind of syntax for its specs which is a mixture of the
 [normal rpm spec syntax][rpmguide] plus a few macros that get expanded at 
 build time.

## CMS spec files specific macros:

* `## NOCOMPILER`: the package will not depend on the compiler.
* `## REVISION <n>`: allows the developer to specify which revision (`<n>`) 
  use for the resulting rpm. 

## Specifying sources:

One of the addition that `cmsBuild` adds to normal rpm spec files is the ability
to download sources which are specified in the `SourceN:` tags using various 
method. This requires the urls to be specified in a special format, especially 
for fetching data from cvs, svn and git.


### Fetching sources from http/https/ftp

The syntax is simply

    Source[0-9]*: <url>

Where `<url>` is the url pointing to the file.

###  Fetching sources from cvs:

In order to fetch sources from cvs, you need to specify a few options to login 
on the server select the correct module.
The full syntax is:

    Source[0-9]*: cvs://<server>?<options>
    
Where `<server>` uses the usual way of specifying a `CVSROOT`, e.g.
  
    :pserver:anonymous@cmscvs.cern.ch:2401/cvs_server/repositories/CMSSW
    
Where `<options>` can be either:
  
* `passwd`: cypted password to access the repository.
* `module`: the name of the cvs module to be used for checkout
* `export`: the directory where the files are checked out (the -d option passed to cvs).
* `strategy`: can be either `checkout` or `export` and tells the system what 
  cvs command to use to download sources.
* `output`: the name of the tarfile where the sources have to be packed. Notice that the 
  value of this option has to start with '/'.
